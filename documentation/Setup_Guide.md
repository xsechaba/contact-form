# Setup Guide for AWS Integrated Contact Form

This comprehensive guide provides step-by-step instructions to replicate the setup for the AWS integrated contact form project. It includes deploying the form, configuring the backend, and setting up necessary AWS services.

## Overview

1. **Frontend Setup**
2. **Backend Setup**
3. **AWS Configuration**

## Step 1: Frontend Setup

- **Deploy the Contact Form**
  - Navigate to the `/frontend` directory in the repository.
  - Review and use the `index.html` and `script.js` files to set up the contact form on your website.
  - Detailed instructions can be found in the `/frontend` directory.

## Step 2: Backend Setup

- **Lambda Function Configuration**
  - Set up the AWS Lambda function that will process the form submissions.
  - Use the `lambda_function.py` file found in the `/backend` directory.
  - Ensure that the Lambda function is properly linked to the API Gateway trigger.

- **API Gateway Configuration**
  - Configure the API Gateway to manage the requests between the frontend and the Lambda function.
  - Detailed steps for setting up the API Gateway and enabling CORS can be found in [API_Configuration.md](/backend/API_Configuration.md).

## Step 3: AWS Configuration

- **SNS Setup**
  - Configure Amazon SNS to send notifications upon form submissions.
  - Refer to [SNS_Setup.md](/aws_configuration/SNS_Setup.md) for detailed setup instructions.

- **IAM Role Configuration**
  - Create and configure the necessary IAM roles for the Lambda function to interact securely with other AWS services like SNS.
  - Refer to [IAM_Role.md](/aws_configuration/IAM_Role.md) for detailed instructions on setting up the IAM roles.

## Step 4: Testing and Validation

- **Local Testing**
  - Test the entire setup locally or in a development environment to ensure everything is integrated and functioning correctly.
  - Use tools like Postman to simulate API requests and check the response.

- **Deploy and Monitor**
  - Once tested, deploy the changes to your production environment.
  - Monitor the application using AWS CloudWatch to ensure that it operates as expected under real-world conditions.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully replicate and deploy the AWS integrated contact form. This setup ensures a robust and scalable application that leverages AWS services for enhanced functionality and performance.
